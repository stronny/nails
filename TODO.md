Things to do when you're bored
==============================

High priority
-------------
- nails database and `bin/nail` to use it
- populate "standard" nail distro with universally useful things like Reflection, Signals, Marsh etc.
- make nails' bins callable

Ideas to think about
--------------------
- call and `unset -f` `$nail.init` after sourcing `$nail`
- import with scope (aliases?)
- automodules with `objection`
